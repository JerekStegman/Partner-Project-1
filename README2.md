#### DESCRIPTION
* This is a project created by Jerek Stegman and Danielle Paton. The main goal of this lab is to understand the fundementals of a github repo. 
* We added multiple files including, a python code file, a readme that describes the python code, licensing, a code of conduct, and finally this readme
* The code of conduct states that if you are going to work within our scope and use our project you must do so with respect to others. We are friendly to eachother and not harmful, going against this will result in penalty. There is more detail provided in the code itself.
* The license states that anyone can use this project for their own good, change it how they like, profit, essentially do what they want but they cannot sue us
* The reason we chose this license and code of conduct is because it allows for a great deal of collaboration without having to worry about hateful usage. We want people to be able to do what they want with our code without being a liability.
